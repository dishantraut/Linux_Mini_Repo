# remove
rm
	No output is produced by rm, since it typically only generates messages in the case of an error.

rm -i (Iterative Deletion)
	-i option makes the command ask the user for confirmation before removing each file, 
	you have to press y for confirm deletion, any other key leaves the file un-deleted.

rm -f (Force Deletion)
	The -f option overrides this minor protection and removes the file forcefully.

rm -r (Recursive Deletion)
	option rm command performs a tree-walk and will delete all the files and sub-directories recursively of the parent directory. 
	At each stage it deletes everything it finds. Normally, rm wouldn’t delete the directories but when used with this option, 
	it will delete.
	
rm -rf *
	Force & Recursive Delete all content of directory 

rm -- -try.txt
	To remove a file whose name begins with a dash (“-“), you can specify a double dash (“–“) separately before the file name. 
	This extra dash is necessary so that rm does not misinterpret the file name as an option. 
	Let say their is a file name -file.txt
	
rm --version
	to get the version of rm you are running

find . -type f ! -iname "*.html" -delete
	delete files excluding specific extension
